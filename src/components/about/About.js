<p>Joyce Somerville began exploring natural solutions for her family’s skin in 2008. After researching, she found that African Shea Butter had the wonderful emollient properties that she and her family needed to keep their skin soft, moisturized and glowing. So for five years she hand-whipped the Shea Butter and a few other ingredients for she and her family to lavish on their skin.</p>
<p>It wasn’t  until she and her family moved to the Atlanta area that they decided this MUST be shared. And so LeBlis was born. With the help of her husband Shaheed Somerville, LeBlis signature butters and body products are created with love and care right in their kitchen.</p>
<p>Hand-whipped, jarred and labeled right from home. You probably can’t get more homemade.
We can’t wait until you try it! Thank you for choosing LeBlis !</p></div>
